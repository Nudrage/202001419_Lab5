  Lab 5 - Static Analysis
</p>
Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability, performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the development process.

<br>**Tool used - Flake8**</br>
Flake8 is a command-line tool that checks Python source code for style and syntax errors. It combines several tools, including PyFlakes, pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8), and McCabe, to provide a comprehensive source code analysis. PyFlakes is used to check for errors such as undefined names, unused variables, and unused imports. Pycodestyle is used to enforce Python's PEP 8 style guide, which provides a set of guidelines for formatting and organizing code. McCabe is used to detect overly complex code that may be difficult to maintain or understand. By running Flake8 on your Python code, you can ensure that your code follows the recommended style guidelines and is free of syntax and style errors. This can help make your code more readable, maintainable, and consistent with the broader Python community.</br>
Here's an example of the output generated by Flake8 when it detects an error: 
<p align="center"> example.py:5:17: E225 missing whitespace around operator </p>
Let's break down what this output means:</br>
example.py -is the name of the Python file where the error was detected.</br>
5:17 - indicates the line number and column number where the error was detected.</br>
E225 - is the error code, which corresponds to a specific error or style violation.</br>
missing whitespace around operator - is a human-readable description of the error that provides more context about the issue.</br>
